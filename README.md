Team UpThrust, a group of six engineering undergraduates, 
developed a Smart Solar Inverter design which could be potentially utilized to 
create a self-sustaining solar powered village/city. 
This fully functional solar inverter is able to communicate with nearby inverters 
via IoT to build a WAN and efficiently distribute energy among the houses.
